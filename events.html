            <li>Following this a plantation drive was also completed. Children with their own hands planted the little
              saplings in the ground, covered them with dirt and manure and watered them. Many such little saplings were
              planted and children enjoyed planting them. Some children even gleefully asked when would the saplings
              turn
              into a tree. Children learned a few very important lessons like how our planet, the whole human kind is
              dependent on the well being of nature and how terrorising it can be if the balance of the ecology is lost.
